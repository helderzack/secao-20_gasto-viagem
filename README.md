# Travel Expense (Gasto de Viagem in portuguese)

This repository was made as my solution to the exercise proposed in the 20th section of the [App Development Using Kotlin - Desenvolvimento de Aplicativos Android Usando Kotlin in portuguese](https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-desenvolvedor-kotlin/) course. The way I have approached the development of this app is simple: first I've tried to code the app as close as possible to the result intended by the teacher. Then, I'll check the section to see how the teacher tackled the development of this app.
